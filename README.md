The Crowdfunding web 3.0 application that enables users to send transactions 
to the blockchain for specific crowdfunding campaigns, with each transaction 
forever stored on the blockchain. The application was built using several 
programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. The frontend was built using 
ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a build 
tool that provides fast and efficient development workflows. To facilitate rapid 
and scalable styling, the website also incorporates Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS 
framework that simplifies the development process and enables developers to 
create responsive and customizable designs with ease. The backend was built 
using Solidity, a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the 
Ethereum blockchain. The website integrates MetaMask wallet for secure and 
easy transaction processing.
